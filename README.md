# Deep Learning Project: Image Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies deep learning techniques to solve an **image classification problem**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the goal is to correctly classify images into their respective categories.  

The notebook demonstrates the full workflow: data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and insights.

## 🎯 Motivation  
Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision, forming the basis for applications such as:  
- Face and object recognition  
- Medical image analysis  
- Autonomous vehicles  
- Retail and e-commerce (product categorisation)  

This project explores how CNNs can be built and optimised to achieve strong performance on image classification tasks.

2. **Model Development**  
   - Built a baseline deep neural network.  
   - Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for improved performance.  

3. **Training and Optimization**  
   - Used techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalisation to reduce overfitting.  
   - Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs).  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Assessed models using training/validation accuracy and loss curves.  
   - Visualised predictions with confusion matrices.
